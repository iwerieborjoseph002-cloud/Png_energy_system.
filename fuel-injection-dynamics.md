# FUEL INJECTION DYNAMICS 

## 1. INTRODUCTION
Fuel injection dynamics describe the physical and thermodynamic behavior of fuel as it is delivered from an injector into a combustion chamber. In the PNG (Pure Natural Gas) Energy System, this process defines the initial boundary condition for downstream atomization, mixing, ignition, and combustion efficiency.

This model formalizes injection as a time-dependent fluid–energy control system rather than a static flow event.

### Engineering objectives
- Controlled fuel mass delivery  
- Optimized spray formation  
- Improved air–fuel mixing  
- Reduced incomplete combustion losses

## 2. GOVERNING PRINCIPLES OF FUEL INJECTION

### 2.1 Nozzle Flow Dynamics
Fuel discharge is governed by pressure differential across a calibrated orifice.

**Equation:**

Q = C_d A √(2ΔP / ρ)

**Variables:**
- Q = volumetric flow rate (m³/s)
- C_d = discharge coefficient
- A = nozzle area (m²)
- ΔP = pressure difference (Pa)
- ρ = fuel density (kg/m³)

**Interpretation:**
- Higher ΔP → higher jet velocity → better atomization  
- Smaller A → higher velocity but reduced mass flow  

---

### 2.2 Time-Dependent Injection Dynamics
Real injection systems are transient:

Q(t) = C_d A √(2ΔP(t) / ρ)

**Drivers:**
- Injector response time  
- Pressure wave dynamics  
- Valve actuation delay  

Injection behaves as a **dynamic control system**, not a steady flow.

### 2.3 Spray Formation Physics
Jet breakup occurs through instability mechanisms:

- Primary breakup → liquid core disintegration  
- Secondary breakup → droplet fragmentation  

**Key dimensionless effects:**
- Reynolds number → turbulence intensity  
- Weber number → surface tension vs aerodynamic force  

**Outputs:**
- Spray penetration length  
- Cone angle  
- Droplet size distribution

The transition of fuel from a high-pressure liquid jet at the injector nozzle into a dispersed multiphase spray within the combustion chamber, highlighting jet breakup, droplet formation, and spray cone development.

**Engineering significance:**
- Pressure energy → kinetic jet energy  
- Jet instability → atomization  
- Spray geometry → mixing efficiency  

**System role in PNG architecture:**
Injection → Spray Formation → Air–Fuel Mixing → Ignition → Combustion → Energy Output
